Yes, with the information in the new memory, I will be able to understand exactly what has been done in Task 1 and how it lays the foundation for Task 2. Specifically, Task 1 has:

Set up the Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a scalable, modular structure with the src/ directory.
Implemented a custom layout with theme toggle functionality (dark/light mode) and applied Google Fonts (Orbitron, Roboto Slab, and Inter) for styling.
Optimized the website for SEO with a custom title and meta description, ensuring better search engine visibility from the start.
Structured the project for scalability and modularity, with reusable components like the ThemeToggle.
